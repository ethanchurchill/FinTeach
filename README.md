## Getting Started

Before running the application, make sure [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and angular are installed on your machine. Once postgres and node are installed, pull the latest code and navigate to the project directory and run npm install -g @angular/cli to install angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` in the the FinTeach/FinTeach directory for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Project Structure

The FinTeach/FinTeach directory contains the components for the frontend of the application while the nodejs-express-sequelize-postgresql directory contains the backend.
